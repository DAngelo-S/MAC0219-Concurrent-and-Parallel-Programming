# Studies for Concurrent and Parallel Programming

## What is this repository about?

In this repository I'll keep my projects, helpful resources and notes about the class Concurrent and Parallel Programming, from University of SÃ£o Paulo.

The aim of this class is to familiarize the student with the basic concepts and terms of parallel systems, implementation and use of concurrency, present the most used types of architecture, descibre the necessary support for the programming of such systems and present some applications.

## Subjects

We will talk about:
- [ ] Basic concepts: processes, threads, interruptions, scheduling.
- [ ] Concurrence: why it is important and implementation;
- [ ] Concurrent programming problems: deadlock, resource allocation;
- [ ] Concurrent reading and writing, mutal exclusion consensus;
- [ ] Concurrent programming on Unix;
- [ ] Traffic lights, mutexes and monitors;
- [ ] Process control and threads: optimization techniques, fork-join parallelization;
- [ ] Sequential optimization: efficient use of memory, unit stride, blocking;
- [ ] Vector and super scalar instructions, optimization options;
- [ ] Performance analysis;
- [ ] Profiling and performance modeling;
- [ ] Shared memory and introduction to OpenMP Distributed memory and MPI Programming in GPUs, Cuda and new technologies;
- [ ] Parallel computing in the cloud.

## Projects

- **Comparison between two programming languages**:  
Execute two programmings, that does the same job both, and compare its execution time. See more [here](projects/comparision-two-languages).
